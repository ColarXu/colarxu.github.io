1
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,200
{\an8}Sansa!
Heel, heel, heel.

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,360
{\an8}Dogs! No, dogs, come here.

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,160
{\an8}Bollocks.

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,200
{\an8}Piggly squats.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,760
{\an8}Hello, piggies.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,120
How are you all?

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Piggies!

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,440
These are the girls,
they're very playful.

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,760
These are all the
pregnant mothers.

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,560
<i>It was now early March,</i>

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,600
<i>and the explosion of
newborn Piggly Squat piglets</i>

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,720
<i>was due to hit the
farm at any moment.</i>

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Are you
going to give birth?

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,160
<i>Also, as it was March,
Kaleb was busy with the spring crops</i>

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,280
<i>and I'd come up with an idea which
I thought might help him along.</i>

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,920
We're
running out of space.

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,040
- What's in here?
- Fertiliser.

18
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,800
What? What the fuck?

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,640
I bought a hovercraft.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,880
Talk to me!

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,960
Well, as you
know, I love hovercrafts.

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,080
My plan is... He
doesn't know this yet.

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,800
I know you're stunned.

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,400
- A little bit.
- It's for you.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,720
<i>And, as
odd as that sounded,</i>

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,000
<i>I wasn't actually
talking nonsense.</i>

27
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,800
<i>Hovercraft are making a
bid to be the farmer's best friend.</i>

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,880
<i>There's no more of that
dead weight on the axles</i>

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,240
<i>and the truck moves with ease
over the muddiest surface.</i>

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,920
<i>That means the farmer can get
his work done when he wants,</i>

31
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,720
<i>whereas with an ordinary
tractor, it would be impossible.</i>

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>Now there's a hopeless position
for you. Well and truly stuck.</i>

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,840
<i>Temper, temper!</i>

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,840
<i>You can always get one of those
hover trucks with a bit of skirt.</i>

35
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,160
<i>My plan was simple:</i>

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,000
<i>If we used a hovercraft to spray
the crops with fertiliser...</i>

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
Perfect.

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,720
<i>Then we could do away with the
tramlines that normal sprayers need,</i>

39
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,320
<i>so we could plant crops where
those tramlines normally go.</i>

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,440
I did the calculation
last night.

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,960
Do you know how many miles of
tramline there are on this farm?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
- How many miles?
- 54.

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,600
- What?
- 54 miles of tramline.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,240
And they're about that wide.

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,960
So that adds up to...

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,560
Well, I did the cost of lost
crop. It's Â£5,200 a year.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,200
- Wow.
- Now, with this, no tramlines.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,360
<i>Obviously, I then
had to explain to Kaleb</i>

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,320
<i>that operating a hovercraft
is a bit more tricky</i>

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,960
<i>than driving a tractor.</i>

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,080
So you've
got two engines.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Yeah.

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,520
This is your lift engine,

54
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,920
that fills the skirt with air.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,320
Then, once you've got the lift,

56
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,920
you start your
right-hand engine.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,520
This is your throttle.

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
Okay. It's not the brake?

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,160
No. You have no brakes.

60
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,920
Right? You see,
these are your handlebars.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,200
- You see they turn the flaps on the back.
- Okay, yeah. Yeah.

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
They make no difference.

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,520
- Okay.
- Absolutely no difference.

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,200
If you see an obstacle, and you
do that, you're going to hit it.

65
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,480
You have to lean. So basically,
you're either like this...

66
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,760
You sort of lean, get
right over like that.

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,016
- And that steers it?
- And that will make it go right.

68
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,520
And then, get over
like that, and that...

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,480
Get as much weight as
you can, as far over.

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,480
- And that'll steer it.
- And that'll steer it along with...

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,696
- That.
- The handlebars.

72
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,600
But effectively, you've no
braking and no steering.

73
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,536
Okay. Can I have a go
before I start spraying?

74
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,280
Yes, I think that's
a very good idea.

75
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,680
This feels so good,
telling you what to do.

76
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,360
Oh, now it's going.

77
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,680
Wow!

78
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,000
Lean!

79
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,560
Hang on... I'm leaning!

80
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,160
Oh, my God!

81
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,496
Come on, man, you're
supposed to going in a straight line.

82
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,560
This is useless!

83
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,480
That's as
straight as a roundabout!

84
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,320
All right, turn!

85
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,240
Lean!

86
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,760
Lean!

87
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,240
Lean and power!

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,360
My young apprentice
is doing well.

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
I've got it.

90
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,800
Fallen out.
He's fallen out.

91
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Ah!

92
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,160
Not good.

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
Come on, you clown.

94
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,920
I need to learn this
shit, I'm going spraying.

95
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,080
Turn, turn, turn,
turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.

96
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,720
You see, it's just
gliding over the weeds.

97
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,200
Turn, turn,
turn. No... Turn.

98
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,200
We get the spray fitted,
fertiliser applied.

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Turn, turn, turn.

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,240
All we need to do
is teach him how to stop.

101
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,880
<i>With the driving
lesson successfully concluded,</i>

102
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,840
<i>it was time to test the
hovercraft as a crop sprayer.</i>

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,600
Tell you what, you
look like a shit gimp.

104
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
- This is liquid...
- Fertiliser.

105
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
Liquid nitrate.

106
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,120
- Yeah.
- It's phenomenally corrosive.

107
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,120
<i>Once Kaleb had finished
filling my bespoke fertiliser tanks,</i>

108
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,760
<i>we were ready for the off.</i>

109
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,720
You ready?

110
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Yup.

111
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,600
Go ahead,
my young apprentice.

112
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
Yee-haw!

113
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh, it's
spraying, it's spraying.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm getting
good at this!

115
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,880
Woohoo!

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,280
Hey, this isn't bad.

117
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Now just go a little
bit to the left of that.

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
Yeah. On my way.

119
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,520
<i>But then, after
exactly 75 seconds...</i>

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,720
Kaleb, is there any
spray coming out?

121
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
No.

122
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,200
Oh, for fuck's sake.

123
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,160
Is that it?

124
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,400
Oh, I'm empty.

125
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,040
- And how big's this field?
- 20 acres.

126
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,040
How many times are you going
to have to refill with fertiliser?

127
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,640
Er... 25 times.

128
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,200
You're joking.

129
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,160
It's going to take me
about 8 hours to spray this field.

130
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,280
That means I've got to spend
8 hours in this gimp suit.

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,760
I think we stick to
the sprayer, please.

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,040
Can you please undress me?

133
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Cut.

134
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
<i>Clearly, I needed bigger
fertiliser tanks on the hovercraft,</i>

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,200
<i>which meant it would need
more powerful engines</i>

136
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
<i>to deal with the extra weight.</i>

137
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
<i>That was a big job.</i>

138
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,920
<i>And there was no time to do it</i>

139
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
<i>because the next day</i>

140
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,320
<i>winter came back.</i>

141
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,960
<i>And then
the next night,</i>

142
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,560
<i>our feed from the
cameras in the pigloos</i>

143
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,360
<i>suggested one of the Mums
was about to give birth.</i>

144
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,240
Let's see how
she's getting on.

145
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,760
Look, there's
an actual piglet.

146
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,200
That's her first baby ever.

147
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,040
Oh, I think we've
got a problem here.

148
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,280
<i>Concerned that the piglet
was not finding a teat to drink from,</i>

149
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,000
<i>Lisa went in to help.</i>

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,080
Oh my gosh,
there's a teat, there.

151
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,320
Oh, she's on the teat.

152
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
Good little one.

153
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,160
It's March 10th, it
shouldn't be this cold.

154
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,360
The climate is changing.

155
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,880
Somebody needs to mention that

156
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,000
because it's really bad.

157
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,000
This is the best bit
of farming I've had so far.

158
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,320
How many will we get?

159
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,080
How many teats has
this one got, 16?

160
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
- Yeah, yeah, that's 16.
- So she could have 16 piglets.

161
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
<i>This joy, however,
soon turned into concern</i>

162
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,640
<i>because over an hour went by</i>

163
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,840
<i>and no more piglets appeared.</i>

164
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,320
Come on. Come on Mum.

165
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,600
One's not enough.

166
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,840
Come on, you
can do it. Come on.

167
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,600
I was told they were
born like machine gun bullets.

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,120
You know they go duh-duh-duh...

169
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Come on Mum.

170
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
She's properly wobbling.

171
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,400
I would say that is
a pig in distress.

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,480
- The vet's not answering.
<i>- Welcome to the EE voicemail...</i>

173
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,360
And neither is Kaleb.

174
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Shite!

175
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,760
<i>Eventually though,
one of the vets answered.</i>

176
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,000
<i>Hello?</i>

177
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,320
Hi, there. It's Jeremy Clarkson
here at Diddly Squat Farm.

178
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,280
Hum...

179
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,640
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

180
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Well, we've got a gilt

181
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,440
who's given birth to one piglet
an hour and 20 minutes ago

182
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,520
and seems to be
in some distress.

183
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,640
And nothing else has come since.

184
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,400
Is that normal, an hour and 20 minutes
between births, or should we be worried?

185
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,480
- <i>An hour and 20, did you say?</i>
- Yeah.

186
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,720
<i>It's usually
much faster than that.</i>

187
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,680
<i>Is she actively pushing or does she
just look like she's moving around?</i>

188
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
<i>Does she look uncomfortable?</i>

189
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,880
She looks, I would
say, uncomfortable,

190
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,000
but Lisa keeps telling me
that's how people look...

191
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,720
Well... How creatures look
when they're giving birth.

192
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,880
I mean, she's vibrating
and snorting and...

193
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,520
I'd say it looked
like she's in distress

194
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,120
but I'm a man, I have no idea
what I'm talking about so...

195
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,680
Lisa's gone back to the farm to
see if she can find a rubber glove

196
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,320
and is very happy to pop in
there and have a look... A feel.

197
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,856
<i>Yeah, that might be the
first... the best thing to do,</i>

198
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,616
<i>because it's easier for you to have a
feel and see if you can feel anything.</i>

199
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,560
<i>So yeah, have you got any
lube up there as well?</i>

200
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,960
Lisa will have some lube.

201
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
Don't put that on television.

202
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,616
<i>That's fine... if
you go to feel in there</i>

203
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,080
<i>and see if she
can feel a piglet,</i>

204
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
<i>if she can feel front
legs or back legs</i>

205
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
<i>and they feel like they're
coming in the normal position.</i>

206
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,656
She can give
them a bit of a tug?

207
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,280
Okay. Thanks, Jenny.
Take care, bye. Bye.

208
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,400
I have those, but I also have...

209
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,280
Oh, perfect.

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,160
I don't know if I'll be able to
feel much. I think I prefer those.

211
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,800
Okay. Well, let's get in there quickly
because it's nearly two hours now.

212
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,040
According to
Jenny, you put your hand in

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
and if you can feel legs or head,
you've got to try and tease it out.

214
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,000
If it's sideways, we've
got to give her a call.

215
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Good girl,
good girl, good girl.

216
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,320
Oh, I'm so sorry.

217
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
She's stopped.
She's really stopped.

218
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
Okay, I'm
in. I'm in, I'm in.

219
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,280
- And?
- I'm in.

220
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,320
- Oh, my God, that's so far up.
- Can you feel a piglet?

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm not... No. I
really can't feel anything.

222
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,640
They're so far in.

223
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,496
- I'm going to ring Jenny again.
- Please, ring Jenny. I...

224
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,960
Okay,
no, no. Well done.

225
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,280
<i>We can either give
her an injection of oxytocin</i>

226
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,240
<i>which sometimes helps</i>

227
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,280
<i>or in the meantime we can get
her up and walk her around.</i>

228
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,536
What? Get her out and walk her?

229
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,776
<i>If you try and get her
and move her around a little bit</i>

230
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,040
<i>- sometimes it stimulates everything.</i>
- Okay.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,080
Oh, nice.

232
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,080
It's so cold.

233
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,720
Come on, pig.

234
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,600
She's not going to in a million
years. She's in lab our.

235
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,336
Did the vet say:
"Just walk her around"?

236
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,680
When you were in lab our, if
someone had come in with a Maccy D,

237
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,560
you wouldn't have said: "Oh,
I'll follow that." You wouldn't.

238
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,840
- No, although she's a pig.
- Oh, she's coming!

239
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
I can't believe it!

240
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,080
She's actually in lab our

241
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,560
and she's come
out for a Maccy D.

242
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,400
Hum...

243
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm bonding. I'm
bonding with my piglet.

244
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,560
No, don't let her in.

245
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,400
No! She's treading on me.

246
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,920
No! Fucking hell,
what's going on?

247
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,560
I can't find... The
pig has beaten me.

248
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,920
Jesus.

249
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,640
I've been in a wrestling
match with a pig.

250
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,560
- In you go.
- Lisa?

251
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,760
We've got to get
her out for a walk.

252
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,560
That's what the vet said.

253
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,640
- Lisa.
- She's having huge contractions.

254
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
She's been for a walk
and she's having...

255
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,800
She hasn't been for a
walk!

256
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
If I did that, you
wouldn't call that a walk.

257
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
It's coming. It's coming,
it's coming. We have a piglet. Yes!

258
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,520
It's steaming, it's steaming!
She's steaming, there's steam.

259
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,920
It's a big piglet.

260
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,800
There
you go, come here.

261
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Come here slithery girl.

262
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,440
That's two.

263
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,016
There's a fart.
That's another piglet coming.

264
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,136
- Is it?
- Yup.

265
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,560
Pig coming. Pig coming.

266
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,040
Yes, look. Pig three.

267
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,640
Lisa, he's attached... she's
attached to her mother. What do I do?

268
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
What, what, what?

269
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,920
- She's attached with a stringy thing.
- No, that's fine,

270
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,720
it's the umbilical cord. It's part
of it. It's part of the process.

271
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,560
- Go on, lick it.
- Oh, my God, it's so cute.

272
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,040
Three pigs!

273
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,280
Good mother.

274
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,280
<i>Over the next couple
of hours, seven more were born.</i>

275
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,280
<i>And after a quick nap,</i>

276
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,400
<i>we came back to see how
everything was going.</i>

277
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Morning, piggies.

278
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,600
Well done, Mum.

279
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,440
Ten piggies.

280
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,400
- Jeremy?
- What?

281
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,240
There's one here not
moving. Have a look. Can you go in?

282
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,840
Oh no.

283
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,600
Are they okay?

284
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,240
Darling, are they okay?

285
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,800
Oh no, it's a big healthy
one too. Did you get...

286
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,640
Did you get laid on?

287
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Oh no.

288
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,376
Lisa?

289
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,120
Whoa! She's just sat on another one.

290
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,640
Oh, look...

291
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,176
She's obviously
squashing them.

292
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,080
They're perfect.
You're a big lovely one.

293
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,720
And you're a sweet little sow.

294
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,640
So we've got
two, three, four, five.

295
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,200
Wait a minute, seven.
She's lying on one.

296
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
There's only seven.

297
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,080
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

298
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,440
- Where's the other one gone?
- Behind you.

299
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,960
I think she's
lying on one of them again.

300
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,720
- Okay, yeah.
- Yes, there is one behind her.

301
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,120
Oh, for fuck's sake.
She's squashed it again.

302
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,440
- You are a shit mother.
- No, she's not.

303
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,376
She is. She was
lying on one of them.

304
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,640
That's how 2 of them
have obviously died.

305
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,800
- But she's shattered.
- Look, there it is.

306
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,160
Three, four, five, six, seven,
eight. Right, they're all...

307
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
That's better, now.

308
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,040
You mustn't sit
on your children.

309
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,600
You do realise we've got this
every night now for a week.

310
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
We kind of messed up, didn't we?

311
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,840
- We did.
- Yeah.

312
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,120
<i>Sure
enough, that night...</i>

313
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
<i>Another sow started
giving birth.</i>

314
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,040
<i>But this time to a
litter of only three.</i>

315
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,320
How are you doing, Mum?

316
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,000
So now...

317
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
The first one gave birth to ten,

318
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,720
sat on two of them, so
we're down to eight.

319
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,560
Nine, ten, eleven.

320
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,400
And one has been born
down here, this morning.

321
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
That's 12.

322
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,960
She is so enormous.

323
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,800
Oh, look at you! Yes.

324
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,200
So we've got Clumsy Pig, that sat on
two of her piglets and killed them.

325
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,800
Swiz Pig,

326
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,400
that promised to deliver
10 or 12 or 16 piglets

327
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
and delivered only three.

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
And now we've got Unit Pig!

329
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,760
There was... How
did that happen?

330
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,280
I was literally talking to the
camera man for two seconds,

331
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,920
I've looked back in there and
there's another one come out.

332
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,560
This is a good pig,
she's birthing well.

333
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,960
<i>Lisa arrived just in time
to see Unit pop number three out.</i>

334
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,680
There's another one!

335
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Oh!

336
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Come on out. Come on, come on.

337
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,680
<i>By the end of the morning,
Unit had produced ten piglets.</i>

338
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>And because she was an experienced
Mum who'd had litters before,</i>

339
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,720
<i>she seemed to know
what she was doing.</i>

340
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,200
Well done, Mum!

341
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,080
<i>However, when
we checked in later on...</i>

342
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,000
We've got one,
two, three, four,

343
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,560
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

344
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,240
Oh...

345
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Fuck it.

346
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,040
Oh no.

347
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Oh...

348
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,200
I can't bear it. Another one.

349
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,080
- She's obviously squidged it.
- Yeah...

350
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,440
<i>We then went to
check on the other Mums.</i>

351
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,800
- And then this is eight left.
- Yeah.

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,320
Because two died.

353
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,880
There's only seven. She can't
have killed another one.

354
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,920
Oh no...

355
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,560
Oh, for fuck's sake!

356
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,680
Oh my God,
that's so upsetting.

357
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,560
<i>Bottom line,
we'd now lost four piglets</i>

358
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,480
<i>as well as three of the five
surprises that had come along</i>

359
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,080
<i>just over two months earlier.</i>

360
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,400
Oh, they're adorable.

361
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,320
- Seven piglets have died.
- Out of?

362
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,400
Twenty-eight. A quarter
of them have died.

363
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
What are we doing wrong?

364
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,960
<i>Worried that we were indeed
making some terrible mistake...</i>

365
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,376
- Hi.
- How are you?

366
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
Vanessa.

367
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,240
<i>We consulted our
neighbours, Vanessa and Andy,</i>

368
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,880
<i>who'd been pig
farmers for years.</i>

369
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,680
Seven piglets, 25% of
the piglets have been squashed,

370
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,440
- which is a lot, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

371
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,280
But I mean, how...

372
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,736
Mothers
sitting on them.

373
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,080
Okay. I mean, it's not uncommon.

374
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,800
They are
classically terrible mothers.

375
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,800
Some are worse than others.

376
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,800
This breed is
classically terrible?

377
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Yes.

378
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,520
Well, and pigs
in general just...

379
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,400
One thing about the arcs is that

380
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,760
if they're in a big house
altogether with other sows,

381
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,240
the other sows do sort of tell
the one who's sat on her piglets.

382
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,160
They will make some
fuss. They notice it.

383
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,560
If you've got a bad mother,
the others will tell them it.

384
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
<i>Having processed
this information,</i>

385
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,320
<i>we then spoke with Kaleb.</i>

386
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,400
The biggest problem is,
the piglets are cold.

387
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
Now, when the Mum lays down...

388
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,320
The Mum stands up to go and eat, the
piglets are going: "Fuck, it's cold."

389
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,920
It's cold, so they
find each other.

390
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,800
And then the pig comes back
in, the sow comes back in,

391
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,536
then they find the
warmth automatically.

392
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,960
So when the pig
starts to lay down,

393
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,680
- it's trying to get near the warmth ASAP.
- Of the pig.

394
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,720
Do you see what I mean?

395
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,760
- It was bloody cold last night.
- Yeah.

396
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,440
And this is why you're
losing so many piglets.

397
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,960
It's not because you're a bad
pig farmer, you're really good.

398
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,320
And I'm being nice. You
are good. You are good.

399
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
<i>So now we knew
why the piglets were dying,</i>

400
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,720
<i>but we couldn't work
out what to do about it.</i>

401
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,200
<i>And that night, we lost another.</i>

402
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,960
<i>And we had a new problem,</i>

403
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,560
<i>because the remaining pregnant
sow was showing absolutely no sign</i>

404
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,280
<i>of giving birth.</i>

405
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,320
Her milk hasn't even come down.
How can she be so far behind?

406
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,880
She could be barren.

407
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,560
Shall we call her Barren?

408
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,560
Baroness.

409
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,136
Well, this is your
favourite one, this is.

410
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,920
Yes, this is my
friend. She's so gentle.

411
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
She's very lovely.

412
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,160
<i>She was also
eating very little,</i>

413
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,240
<i>so we called out Jenny the vet.</i>

414
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,336
- So this is our poorly pig.
- She's very sweet.

415
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
I hear she's not eating very well,
so that can't be good for anybody.

416
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,440
It means we should
hopefully be close.

417
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,440
Doubtless, Lisa will now arrange for it
to be taken away in a luxury ambulance

418
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,000
and put into a kind
of pig nursing home

419
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,520
with streaming
television to watch.

420
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,360
She's had that
food in front of her now

421
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,120
for 12 hours or more. 18 hours?

422
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,000
And she kind of sits there,
and she doesn't even move.

423
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,840
She kind of puts her tongue
out, almost, and takes a bit.

424
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,776
She snuffles up a bit, she
doesn't eat like a pig.

425
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,920
Yeah, which makes me
think that something's not right.

426
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,600
- She does look really not very happy...
- Yeah.

427
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,320
In the way she's moving.

428
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,760
She's got a rasp in her breathing
when you're listening to her lungs,

429
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,760
so I'm wondering whether she's got
a touch of infection going on there.

430
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,000
So what I probably
will be inclined to do

431
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,120
is give her an anti-inflammatory,
give her an antibiotic,

432
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,560
see how she goes.

433
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,840
Sorry, darling, you're not
going to like this very much.

434
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,360
Good girl.

435
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,560
Okay, she's done.

436
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Well done.

437
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,440
She's pregnant, right?

438
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,120
She definitely
looks really heavy down low,

439
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,360
which suggests that
she might be pregnant.

440
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,480
So that's good. Good girl!

441
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,136
- Thanks, Jenny.
- Let us know if she's not getting better.

442
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,200
Yeah, will do.

443
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,040
<i>While we were waiting anxiously
for Baroness to go into lab our,</i>

444
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
<i>bigger events were
unfolding around us.</i>

445
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,200
<i>Down at West Oxfordshire
District Council,</i>

446
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>a government inspector had arrived
to adjudicate on our appeal</i>

447
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,320
<i>against the enforcement notice.</i>

448
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,760
<i>We'd been advised not to attend,</i>

449
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,840
<i>so instead, we
went into overdrive</i>

450
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,800
<i>to make sure everything in
the farm shop was super local,</i>

451
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,200
<i>council compliant and
completely above board.</i>

452
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,840
This... Ned, who works for
us, he's just turned sixteen,

453
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,520
these are his biscuits, he
makes them on his own kitchen.

454
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,280
Granola, that's a
girl down the road.

455
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,160
Flour comes from that
field over there.

456
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,560
These are all made
up in our kitchen.

457
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,840
This, a neighbour
down the road makes.

458
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,560
This... This is Mrs. Viktor.
Viktor does our honey,

459
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,920
And Mrs. Viktor makes
her soap using our honey.

460
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,840
This is using...

461
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,760
Our delicious jerky

462
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,560
using our chillies again. We're
growing more chillies this year.

463
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,200
These are made in Chipping
Norton from a local baker.

464
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,240
This... This is made
using our wheat.

465
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,240
Err... Over here this is our
gin. That's made in Burford.

466
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,960
The pottery is made
from a local lady.

467
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,840
So this is our past chilli...

468
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,680
The programme's only 40 minutes
long and you've been 28 minutes...

469
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
Shush then.

470
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,400
<i>Of equal importance
was the future of the burger van</i>

471
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,120
<i>because with no restaurant,</i>

472
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,680
<i>this had become the only way of
selling our beef and pork at a profit.</i>

473
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,616
I need a burger and a
truffle and parmesan for this, chef.

474
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,640
Thank you.

475
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,200
<i>Annie, who runs the van, had
been to the council hearing that day</i>

476
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,520
<i>to plead the case for her
business to stay open.</i>

477
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,720
Vomit, what's it like?

478
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,960
It's a big room,
and then there are,

479
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,880
at the back of the room,
sort of, twelve rows

480
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,120
of eight across seats with
an aisle down the middle.

481
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,440
Then you've got the council on one
side with their legal representation,

482
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,360
and then the guy presiding over
the top of all looking down at you.

483
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,240
- Has he got a beard?
- No.

484
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Oh, that's good.

485
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
You go in.

486
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,760
I was late because of a severe
lack of parking, the irony.

487
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,600
So I went in and found
a seat next to Emma,

488
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,840
who does the milk, so I thought
at least I've got an ally.

489
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,040
And then he said would anyone
from the floor like to comment?

490
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,560
I stood up and I said:
"My name is Annabel Gray,

491
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,440
I grew up in a
farming community.

492
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,640
I lived in the countryside
most of my life.

493
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,720
Now I run the catering
trailer behind Diddly Squat."

494
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,440
At which point there was
a gasp around the room.

495
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,400
360s.

496
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,696
I was like: "Oh,
gosh. Here we go."

497
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,800
And I said: "I'm really
passionate about this.

498
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,920
You have got something which
could be a massive asset.

499
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,200
Yes, it's not perfect, you
know. I hide no secrets.

500
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,960
There are stuff we
need to deal with,

501
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,040
but no one knows what you're
next going to get upset about.

502
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,280
So give us the infrastructure
to make it something brilliant."

503
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,400
Exactly. They said we could
have one lavatory, that was sufficient.

504
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,280
And they said that nine car
parking spaces were sufficient.

505
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,800
The council guy that I've just
witnessed is saying based on ten spaces,

506
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,040
everyone get in, get out the car,
you've got five minutes to run round.

507
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,216
If you wanna grab something,

508
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,680
you've got to be back in your
car in five minutes and out.

509
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,400
- In and out in five minutes?
- In five minutes. Yeah.

510
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,480
So if somebody disabled turns up, I
don't know how quickly he can get out.

511
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,960
Let's time him next time.
"You've got five minutes."

512
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,400
But did you get a sense of
how it's going down there?

513
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,696
Are they still trying to
claim it isn't a farm shop?

514
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,800
Yeah, they're saying that
people come and buy things

515
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,960
but actually, it's an
entertainment and leisure facility.

516
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,560
This is what pisses me off
though because I look at that...

517
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,040
Every single thing.

518
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,800
I know where that bread
came from, the wheat, the beer.

519
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
And I look out there
and see your operation.

520
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,960
And that's where all the meat
goes that's cooked in bread

521
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,016
- that's also made with wheat from here.
- In the farms.

522
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,200
And you think it couldn't
be more of a farm.

523
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Admittedly, when
it first started,

524
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,680
we were taking the piss
slightly, but now...

525
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,720
But I did love when
the council said

526
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,680
people are driving past other
farm shops which are better.

527
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,440
And you just think,
our cows are grass-fed.

528
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,400
Yeah.

529
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,040
Nurtured through the winter,

530
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,840
the highest possible quality

531
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,720
and the council...

532
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,320
And it's not really
their business.

533
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,880
They're saying: "Go to another farm
shop, they have better quality produce."

534
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,160
And if they close you
down, we have no way...

535
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,040
If you get closed, we're fucked.

536
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,920
Anyway, thank you ever so much.

537
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,200
Chadlington football shirt.

538
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,800
"My shirt is better
than your shirt."

539
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
I like that.

540
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,400
Oh, Lisa! These are my
scales from the kitchen.

541
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,600
- Lisa!
- What?

542
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,040
These are my scales
from the kitchen.

543
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,280
- No, no, no.
- Yes, they are!

544
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,336
- No, no, no.
- Yes, they are. I couldn't find them.

545
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,040
You've nicked my scales.

546
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,720
I might have needed to borrow
them for a little bit for the veg.

547
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,600
Why don't you buy
the shop a pair?

548
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,200
Because it's up here now.

549
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,120
I couldn't
find those anywhere.

550
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,880
- You don't need to weigh a chicken.
- You do!

551
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,016
You go "That's about 3 pounds," put it
in the oven and see when it's cooked.

552
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,080
Yes, which is why I always have
salmonella when you've cooked.

553
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
- Well, why don't you cook?
- I do fucking cook!

554
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,296
- Well then, you won't get salmonella.
- That's why...

555
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,360
I can't weigh anything.

556
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,600
I never know how much anything
weighs. I wondered where they'd gone.

557
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,720
They're very good by the way.

558
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,680
<i>Having followed
proceedings closely,</i>

559
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,240
<i>Charlie reckoned it would be weeks
before the inspector made a decision.</i>

560
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,680
<i>So all we could do was
get back to farming.</i>

561
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,080
<i>Except we couldn't.</i>

562
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,000
<i>In mid-March, it
started to rain,</i>

563
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,360
<i>and it didn't stop for days.</i>

564
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,960
<i>This hit Kaleb especially hard</i>

565
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,000
<i>because it was too wet to
plant his most valuable crop.</i>

566
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
The durum wheat is
our big money crop,

567
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,800
and it could pull a lot of money,
especially for my board this year,

568
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,200
it might potentially be
profit and loss, so...

569
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,176
We've grown it for the last two years
and we've seen how good it can be,

570
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,400
but annoyingly you need to
get it in in perfect timing

571
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,320
because if you don't, it
suffers through the summer

572
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,240
and then the yields
are normally down.

573
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,360
Hum... I wanted to... Yeah.

574
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,840
It's never going to stop
raining, I don't think.

575
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,640
<i>The endless wetness meant
we couldn't work on the dam either.</i>

576
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,960
Not a chance.

577
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,040
It's a lot
of water, isn't it?

578
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,640
It's basically
washed the clay away, look.

579
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,096
Well, we've got to wait for the
water to go down. We cannot...

580
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Yeah.

581
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
I agree.

582
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,160
I wanna go farming.

583
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,080
- You can't, it's raining.
- I know.

584
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,680
<i>There was though some
good news from the pig wood,</i>

585
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,600
<i>because thankfully there had
been no more piglet deaths.</i>

586
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,800
<i>Baroness, though, still
hadn't gone into lab our.</i>

587
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,960
<i>And despite a week of antibiotics,
she was clearly no better.</i>

588
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,960
Slept outside last night
because she's so hot.

589
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,400
She's not eating at all.

590
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,960
I don't know what
we're doing wrong.

591
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,400
Something, right?

592
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,120
I mean...

593
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,840
This is...

594
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
It's heart-breaking.

595
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,360
Oh, Jenny's here, look.

596
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,080
Still unwell?

597
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Yeah.

598
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,120
- She slept outside last night.
- Yeah.

599
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,840
So her temperature went down
probably because she slept outside.

600
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,280
- Yeah.
- But her breathing is laboured.

601
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,160
Yeah, I'll take
the second temperature.

602
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,160
But it could be that
if she's got pregnant

603
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,200
and then had the
piglets die inside,

604
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,520
they might not be triggering
her to give birth,

605
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,160
but they might be sitting there,

606
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,440
- rotting inside her.
- What do you do in that situation?

607
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,680
Possibly try and induce her
so she'll kick them out.

608
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,360
<i>Without more ado, we
began the inducement procedure.</i>

609
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,840
If the piglets are dead,

610
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,976
then we'll just concentrate
on getting her well again,

611
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,240
- and then...
- Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,280
Behind the ear. Inject.

613
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,496
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

614
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,680
So three o'clock tomorrow,

615
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,600
with the second injection,
which you'll do.

616
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,880
Yeah, I can do that.

617
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,800
It only should be a small amount, not
like that big antibiotic injection.

618
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,680
No, exactly.

619
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,856
So you've only got a small amount
and it should go really easily.

620
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Okay, that's fine.

621
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,680
I'm going
to give her this

622
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,360
and then in four to
twelve hours' time,

623
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,880
she should be starting
to give birth.

624
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,800
There we go. Oh, my
God, hello my friend.

625
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,760
Done.

626
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Yup!

627
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,480
<i>By late afternoon,
the medicine started to work,</i>

628
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,120
<i>and she gave birth to a
piglet that was alive.</i>

629
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,440
<i>But there were still problems.</i>

630
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,160
So the whole
process has started.

631
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,320
She's given birth to
one really small piglet.

632
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,120
She has no milk,

633
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,400
and the piglet is in there
just looking for a teat

634
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,680
and there's no food.

635
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
How are we doing?

636
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,720
She's had
one, she has no milk.

637
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,440
Look at that.

638
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,600
Oh, Jesus.

639
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,560
It's absolutely tiny.

640
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,840
- Have we got any pig milk? Like SMA?
- No.

641
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,560
I mean, that's not
a healthy piglet, is it?

642
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,120
<i>Hello,
veterinary clinic.</i>

643
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,496
- Hi, Nathan?
<i>- Hi, there.</i>

644
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,456
Hi, it's Jeremy
Clarkson up at Diddly Squat.

645
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

646
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,160
Sorry to trouble you. I gather both
Dilwyn and Jenny are not there,

647
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,280
so I'm troubling you.

648
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,976
- I don't...
<i>- That's all right.</i>

649
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,840
I don't know if you're
up to speed on our sickly sow.

650
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,400
She's popped a piglet out
that is the size of a mouse.

651
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,560
She's not producing any milk.

652
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,120
I was wondering if you
had any suggestions.

653
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,296
<i>So basically, if she's
not letting down any milk,</i>

654
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,800
<i>it's because she's
not producing any.</i>

655
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,536
<i>So, the next step is
basically going to be</i>

656
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,480
<i>bottle feeding the piglets
with some colostrum.</i>

657
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,000
Colostrum? Where do
we get colostrum from?

658
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:27,160
<i>So, I think in this case it
would probably be easiest if we use</i>

659
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,280
<i>a sort of pre-made
lamb colostrum.</i>

660
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,800
<i>So I think what we'll do is</i>

661
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,360
<i>we'll put some up at the
practice for you to collect</i>

662
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,160
<i>and it will be a case of
following the instructions on it,</i>

663
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,600
<i>mixing it up and bottle
feeding the piglets with it.</i>

664
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,680
All right,
Nathan, thanks. Bye, bye.

665
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,760
<i>No worries,
take care now, bye.</i>

666
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,320
<i>A member of the film
crew went off to get the formula</i>

667
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,560
<i>and then Kaleb arrived...</i>

668
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,520
- Is she still trying to push?
- Yeah.

669
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,600
<i>Just as Baroness
gave birth to piglet number 2.</i>

670
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,680
Oh! Yes, another one.

671
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,016
Is there another one?

672
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,296
Yeah, we
have another one.

673
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,360
Is it alive?

674
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,840
Yeah. There we go.

675
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,480
God, is that
one even smaller? Yeah.

676
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,600
That one is unbelievably tiny.

677
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,400
"I'm fucking
hungry!" I bet you are.

678
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,160
This one is
weak as hell, Kaleb.

679
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
One of them is as weak as hell.

680
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,600
That runt,
that little tiny one?

681
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,280
No, the bigger one. She
can't open her mouth.

682
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,960
She's just, you know... Her head's
flopping around on the nipple.

683
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,080
<i>Luckily, the formula
milk was now ready to go.</i>

684
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,280
All right. Well done.

685
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,600
- That's it.
- Almost.

686
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Good.

687
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,640
That's perfect.

688
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,160
We'll make
you a big strong pig.

689
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
We'll have you up
and about in no time.

690
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:17,280
<i>Then Nathan arrived and
started to work vet miracles.</i>

691
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,640
We've got one.

692
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,920
- He's okay?
- Yup, alive.

693
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,680
Here we go, another one.

694
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,736
- Lisa?
- Yes?

695
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,640
- How many now?
- Four.

696
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,680
- Are they all alive?
- Yes.

697
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,840
- Are they tiny?
- Yes.

698
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,280
Hang on.
I've got another one.

699
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,600
<i>Soon, Baroness
was mother to five piglets.</i>

700
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,480
I'm just going to put them
all next to Mum for a bit of warmth.

701
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,920
Because he's a bit cold there.
Just pop them all together.

702
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,920
<i>And having
bottle fed them all,</i>

703
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,560
<i>we went home to
grab a bit of sleep.</i>

704
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,680
<i>The next morning,</i>

705
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,600
<i>we found that three of
the piglets had died.</i>

706
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,120
<i>They'd simply been
too weak to survive.</i>

707
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,680
<i>We moved the remaining two
to a heated pen at the farm,</i>

708
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,600
<i>but even that wasn't working.</i>

709
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,440
Another dead one.

710
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,040
Oh!

711
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,320
- Is that the only one that's left?
- We've got one more.

712
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,520
How's the
mother? Is she okay?

713
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,960
She's still alive.

714
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,040
We're losing a lot of piglets.

715
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,520
- What?
- We're losing a lot of piglets.

716
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,440
It's really tough, isn't it?

717
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,496
And this one, we just have to feed
this one every 10 minutes or something.

718
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,120
I can't remember
what the vet said.

719
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Come here, you.

720
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,080
We've still got a feisty one.

721
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,680
Is this the one
that was born second?

722
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,120
I've lost count.
I honestly don't know.

723
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,480
We'll make it our life's mission
to make that piglet survive.

724
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,440
Yeah.

725
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,840
And her mother.

726
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
The mother will survive.

727
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,680
I'll go down and see her now.

728
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,840
You're going down?

729
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,760
<i>That night we did what even
the most hard-hearted farmer will do</i>

730
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,880
<i>at a time like this.</i>

731
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,160
Come on. There we go.

732
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,000
<i>We took the sickly piglet into
our kitchen to look after it there.</i>

733
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,800
There we go.

734
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Come on.

735
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
There we go.

736
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,400
Still a bit small.

737
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,400
It's still a bit cold to be
honest. Your ears are cold.

738
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,440
Okay, let's pop
you back in there.

739
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,680
Okay, get nice and warm. Yeah.

740
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,680
Now, I'm not going
to put you in,

741
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,256
but it's just a lot warmer here, okay?

742
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,480
I know. I'm sorry.

743
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,520
There we go, okay?

744
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,080
<i>The next
day, irony of ironies,</i>

745
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,320
<i>we had to go to the farm shop
to meet Andy Garcia the butcher.</i>

746
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,800
There's lots of it.
Let's take a look at it.

747
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,600
<i>He'd finished preparing the
pigs I'd recently taken to slaughter.</i>

748
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,360
Seven boxes, two
pigs' worth of pork in these.

749
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,320
You should be doing the lifting,
really. They're your pigs.

750
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,960
You're young and I've
seen you hold a pram

751
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,160
- while aiming your gun at Al Capone.
- Look at that. This is your favourite.

752
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
- These are belly pork strips.
- Yum.

753
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,000
Pork chops there.

754
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,120
You can tell they're really nice pigs
because of the amount of fat on them.

755
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,920
Whoever's looking after
them is doing a great job.

756
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,640
Erm... You can see that they're
going to eat really well.

757
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,920
Lots of sausages.

758
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,880
Holy moly.

759
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,160
Carolina Reaper
and honey sausages.

760
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,880
- Oh, my giddy aunt.
- There's another box.

761
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,400
Two pigs have produced

762
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,760
4, 8.

763
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,480
- Jesus!
- There's 36 packs of six in a box.

764
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,320
Jeremy, Sandy and
Black Forest Sausages.

765
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,016
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good doesn't it.

766
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,200
This is so
good for my side of the chart.

767
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,160
God, strewth, that's brilliant.

768
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,600
Except it is so... One of the things
I can't get my head around is,

769
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,960
we're having a really tottering
time with the piglet births.

770
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,160
Hmm.

771
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,520
- Really tottering.
- Hmm-hmm.

772
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,040
So you're up all night, sort of nurturing
these pigs and trying to make them warm,

773
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,600
trying to make them comfortable
and trying to make them alive.

774
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,800
Yeah.

775
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,680
And then you break off...

776
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,040
to come here and
receive all this.

777
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,480
Yeah.

778
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,680
Mixed emotions.

779
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,560
There's only one expression I can
think of, and it's farmer logic.

780
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,200
'Cause you love animals. All
farmers love their animals.

781
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
- And then they kill them and sell them.
- Hmm.

782
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,080
This way you can love them twice.

783
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,160
<i>Back at the farm, as
the rain continued to fall,</i>

784
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,000
<i>I brought the poorly
piglet into my office</i>

785
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,640
<i>so I could keep an eye on
her while I was working.</i>

786
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,520
I've moved her away from the
Aga and brought her next to

787
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,520
the stove in the barn.

788
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,760
And she's really not well.

789
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,440
Hey.

790
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,760
No...

791
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,840
- She's the last one.
- I know.

792
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,640
I know, come on.

793
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
No?

794
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,120
It's okay, little one.
I'm with you, okay?

795
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,360
You can go, I'll stay with you.

796
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,080
- And her mother's not well either.
- I know.

797
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,600
She's worse than she was
before, to be honest.

798
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,800
She is.

799
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,040
I just find that heart-breaking.

800
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
Hi, Jenny.

801
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,040
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, there.

802
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,640
Another familiar sight.

803
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,960
- I've heard she's not doing well.
- Yeah.

804
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,960
No, I'm afraid she's
passed. There's nothing there.

805
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,480
- Did she come out very little?
- Yeah.

806
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,640
But...

807
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,600
I can't do this. I can't
have pigs anymore, honestly.

808
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,200
- A nightmare. I like them too much.
- Hmm.

809
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:49,360
<i>Unbelievably,
the torment wasn't over.</i>

810
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,440
<i>Because we then had to turn
our attention to Baroness,</i>

811
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,640
<i>now that every single one
of her piglets had died.</i>

812
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,040
Hello,
darling. Hi, sweet pea.

813
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,680
Good girl.

814
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,640
Good girl.

815
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,136
What are
you doing now, Jenny?

816
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,800
Just taking her temperature,
to see whether she has got a fever.

817
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,680
She's very wobbly though.

818
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,296
- She's walking like she's drunk.
- She's really wobbly.

819
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,120
Yeah. Look.

820
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,216
You can see her
swaying from side to side.

821
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,320
She hasn't eaten. She's had a
bit of water, and that's it.

822
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,000
You can see on the back end. Her
bum should be round with muscle.

823
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,800
It's really straight
up and down.

824
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,800
She's obviously lost a huge amount
of muscle there and support.

825
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,480
And the problem is,
especially on this terrain,

826
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,400
where she's up and down hills
and it's all a bit lumpy bumpy,

827
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,080
I'm really worried that she's
going to get to the point

828
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,440
that she's just going
to go off those legs

829
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,000
and collapse.

830
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,560
It could be something cancerous.

831
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,960
The other thing you
could be dealing with

832
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,360
is if you've got some
damage to the liver.

833
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,880
Neither of which are...

834
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,160
- Curable.
- Yeah.

835
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,320
Is she suffering now?

836
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,520
Any animal that's not
eating is not in a good state.

837
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,440
She's so unsteady
on her feet, isn't she?

838
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,560
If you don't make
the decision now,

839
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,481
I have a feeling that we'll be in
this position in another week's time

840
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,960
with her collapsed down
the bottom of there.

841
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,480
If she's not going to get
better and she's suffering,

842
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,800
it's Dignitas time.

843
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,040
Yeah.

844
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,680
So if you want me
to do the deed,

845
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,120
then I'll sort it out,

846
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,280
and then you'll need to get
someone in to take her away

847
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,136
- after everything's done.
- When would you do the deed?

848
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,200
I can do it now,

849
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,720
if you would like.

850
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,960
Fucking hell.

851
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,440
- What do you think?
- I can give you a bit of time.

852
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,080
I don't want her to be unhappy,
in pain, or to get sicker.

853
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,136
- And then...
- You don't want her to die either.

854
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,960
I don't want her to die with a
broken leg having fallen down there

855
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,720
and just be all
crumpled up and alone.

856
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,640
I know. It's always
a really difficult decision.

857
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,320
She's so lovely.

858
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,456
She does seem like she's
got a bit of a sweet nature.

859
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,840
She's really sweet. She's
always been the sweetest.

860
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah.

861
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,560
Well...

862
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,240
Yeah? Time?

863
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,080
It's fine. You don't have to be
present if you don't want to be.

864
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,840
- Yeah. I don't want to see it.
- No.

865
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,640
- Thanks, Jenny.
- That's not a problem. Okay.

866
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,480
Bye, Baroness.

867
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,360
Oh, God...

868
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,520
All right, darling.
Time's up, I'm afraid.
